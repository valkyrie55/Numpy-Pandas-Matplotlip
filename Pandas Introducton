Pandas contain data structures amd data manipulation tools designed to make data cleaning and analysis fast and easy in python.
Let's get familiar with two workhouse data structures:Series and Dataframes.

Series : 
      A one-D  array like object containing a sequence of values(of  similar types to numpy types).It has index on the left and values on the right.
      It can be thought of as a fixed length,ordered dictionary. 

Dataframe:
     A Dataframe is a rectangular table of data and contains an ordered collection of colmns,each of which can be of a different value type(numeric,string,boolean etc)
     It has both row and column index.
