A List is a python data structure that holds many python objects.It is flexible(can be filled with data of desired type).Numpy arrays lack flexibility but are much more efficient for storing and manipulating data.
Numpy-Numerical python is the fundamental package for scientific computing with python . If you are going to work on data analysis or machine learning projects, then having a solid understanding of numpy is nearly mandatory.

The key difference between an array and a list is, arrays are designed to handle vectorized operations while a python list is not.
That means, if you apply a function it is performed on every item in the array, rather than on the whole array object.
Numpy provides the excellent ndarray objects, short for n-dimensional arrays.
In an ‘ndarray’ object we can store multiple items of the same data type.
There are very significant advantages of using numpy arrays overs lists,without wasting any more time let's go through it

# ndarray.shape - the dimensions of the array
# ndarray.dtype - an object describing the type of the elements in the array.
# ndarray.size - total no. of elements in the array
