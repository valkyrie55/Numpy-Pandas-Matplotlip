Numpy-Numerical python is the fundamental package for scientific computing with python . If you are going to work on data analysis or machine learning projects, then having a solid understanding of numpy is nearly mandatory.

Numpy provides the excellent ndarray objects, short for n-dimensional arrays.

In an ‘ndarray’ object we can store multiple items of the same data type.
There are very significant advantages of using numpy arrays overs lists,without wasting any more time let's go through it

# ndarray.shape - the dimensions of the array
# ndarray.dtype - an object describing the type of the elements in the array.
# ndarray.size - total no. of elements in the array
